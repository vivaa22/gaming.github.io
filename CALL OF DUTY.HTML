<Body><P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:FANTASY;FONT-SIZE:30;COLOR:WHITE;">Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War II. However, over time, the series has seen games set in modern times, the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. a good tip to play this game would be to speed up your reaction time there are many websites which can test and help you to improve your reaction time. Also it would be a good idea to play this game with headphones since people can sneak up behind you and will shoot you when your least expecting it so hearing there footsteps is everything. the last tip would probably be to always adjust your sensivity settings as with most fps games sensivity is everything i would recomend a medium sensivity since it correspond to my reaction time but thats just for me.thats it for call of duty move on to the next one now.</P><BR>
