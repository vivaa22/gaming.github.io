<Body><P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:FANTASY;FONT-SIZE:30;COLOR:WHITE;">Dead Effect 2 is a 2015 video game developed and published by BadFly Interactive. It is a sequel to Dead Effect. You can always go back to the healing pods and heal again anytime, unless a door locks behind you. ...
For the most part, you will need to aim for the head, but not always. ...
Another way to conserve ammo is by luring enemies through narrow hallways and use the electromagnetic stun gun.</P><BR>
