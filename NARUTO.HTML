It is the sequel to Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution.To get the most out of your melee attacks, it's best to mix things up. Keep your foe guessing by weaving jutsu techniques into your string, or cancel out of the combo with a dash or chakra dash. You could even try calling in your allies and seeing whether you can tie their specific actions into your own offensive.</P><BR>
